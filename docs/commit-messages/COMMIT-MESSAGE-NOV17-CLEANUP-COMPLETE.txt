docs: Cleanup complete - Architecture simplified và file structure organized

## SUMMARY
Hoàn tất cleanup toàn diện sau Phase 5:
- Tổ chức lại ~90 documentation files
- Remove deprecated signaling service
- Simplify architecture từ 14→13 services
- Tiết kiệm ~1.5GB RAM

## THAY ĐỔI

### 1. File structure reorganization
Root level:
- Before: 50+ markdown files (clutter)
- After: 3 essential files (clean)
  * README.md
  * ROADMAP-UPDATED-OCT2025.md
  * DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md

Created new structure:
- docs/wrap-ups/ - Session reports
- docs/reports/phase*/ - Phase-specific reports
- docs/commit-messages/ - Git commit messages
- demos/html/ - HTML demo files

Moved ~90 files to proper locations.

### 2. Architecture cleanup
Removed from stack-hybrid.yml:
- signaling service (P2P Socket.IO)
  * 3 replicas @ 512MB each
  * Unused since Frontend 1.0.34
  * Replaced by Gateway SFU

Service count: 14 → 13

### 3. Documentation updates
Created:
- docs/README.md - Documentation overview
- docs/wrap-ups/README.md - Wrap-up guide
- docs/reports/DEPRECATED-SERVICES-NOV17.md - Deprecation docs
- CLEANUP-SUMMARY-NOV17.txt - This cleanup summary
- docs/commit-messages/COMMIT-MESSAGE-NOV17-*.txt - Commit messages

Updated:
- DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md - Complete restructure
- README.md - Service count 14→13
- ROADMAP-UPDATED-OCT2025.md - Phase 5 100% complete
- infrastructure/swarm/stack-hybrid.yml - Removed signaling

Backup:
- infrastructure/swarm/stack-hybrid-with-signaling.yml.backup

## REASONS

### Why file reorganization?
- Root directory had 50+ markdown files
- Hard to navigate and find documents
- No clear structure for phase reports
- Needed scalable organization for future phases

### Why remove signaling service?
- Architecture mismatch: P2P signaling vs SFU architecture
- Resource waste: 1.5GB RAM unused
- Maintenance burden: Duplicate Socket.IO logic
- Technical debt: Not used since Frontend 1.0.34 (Nov 10)
- Gateway SFU proven stable for weeks

## BENEFITS

### File structure:
✅ Clean root directory (3 files only)
✅ Easy navigation by phase/topic
✅ Scalable for future phases
✅ Professional project organization
✅ Quick access to current status

### Architecture:
✅ Simpler architecture (single video service)
✅ ~1.5GB RAM freed for AI models
✅ Easier maintenance (no duplicate logic)
✅ Clearer service responsibilities
✅ Ready for Phase 6 integration

### Documentation:
✅ Comprehensive deprecation guide
✅ Rollback procedures documented
✅ Architecture comparison (P2P vs SFU)
✅ Resource savings tracked
✅ Migration paths clear

## TESTING

### Before deployment:
- [x] Backup created: stack-hybrid-with-signaling.yml.backup
- [x] Documentation complete
- [x] File structure verified (ls -1 *.md → 3 files)
- [x] Service count verified (grep services → 13 services)

### After deployment (Optional):
- [ ] docker service ls → 13 services
- [ ] docker service ls | grep signaling → empty
- [ ] curl https://webrtc.jbcalling.site/health → 200 OK
- [ ] Test video call at https://jbcalling.site
- [ ] Monitor resource usage (~1.5GB reduction)
- [ ] Gateway logs clean (no errors)

### Rollback (if needed):
```bash
cd infrastructure/swarm
scp stack-hybrid-with-signaling.yml.backup translation01:/tmp/
ssh translation01 "docker stack deploy -c /tmp/stack-hybrid-with-signaling.yml.backup translation"
```

## IMPACT

### Production:
- LOW RISK: Service not in use since Nov 10
- NO DOWNTIME: Stack update is graceful
- RESOURCE SAVINGS: ~1.5GB RAM freed
- ARCHITECTURE: Simplified, easier to maintain

### Development:
- EASIER NAVIGATION: Documents well organized
- CLEAR STRUCTURE: Phase reports separated
- HISTORICAL CONTEXT: All commits documented
- SCALABLE: Ready for Phase 6 and beyond

### Documentation:
- COMPREHENSIVE: 83+ docs organized
- NAVIGABLE: DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md updated
- SEARCHABLE: Structured by topic/phase
- MAINTAINABLE: Clear naming conventions

## FILES AFFECTED

Modified:
- infrastructure/swarm/stack-hybrid.yml (removed signaling)
- DOCUMENTATION-INDEX.md (complete restructure)
- README.md (service count, architecture note)
- ROADMAP-UPDATED-OCT2025.md (Phase 5 complete)

Created:
- docs/README.md
- docs/wrap-ups/README.md
- docs/reports/DEPRECATED-SERVICES-NOV17.md
- docs/commit-messages/COMMIT-MESSAGE-NOV17-*.txt
- CLEANUP-SUMMARY-NOV17.txt
- infrastructure/swarm/stack-hybrid-with-signaling.yml.backup

Moved:
- WRAP-UP-*.md → docs/wrap-ups/
- COMMIT*.txt → docs/commit-messages/
- PHASE*-*.md → docs/reports/phase*/
- HOTFIX-*.md, *-FIX-*.md → docs/reports/hotfixes/
- *-INVESTIGATION-*.md → docs/reports/investigations/
- demo-*.html, test-*.html → demos/html/

## NEXT STEPS

1. **Optional deployment** (low risk):
   ```bash
   cd infrastructure/swarm
   scp stack-hybrid.yml translation01:/tmp/
   ssh translation01 "docker stack deploy -c /tmp/stack-hybrid.yml translation"
   ```

2. **Verify cleanup**:
   - Service count: 13
   - Gateway health: OK
   - Video calling: Working
   - Resource usage: ~1.5GB lower

3. **Monitor for 24h**:
   - Gateway logs clean
   - No service errors
   - Resource usage stable
   - Video calls working

4. **Phase 6 preparation**:
   - Architecture clean and simple
   - No service conflicts
   - Resources freed for AI models
   - Documentation ready
