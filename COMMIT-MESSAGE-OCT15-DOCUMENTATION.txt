   - Status banner: ⚠️ 95% Complete (Gateway routing issue)
   - Updated live demo URLs
   - Recent achievements Oct 14-15
   - Performance metrics validated from production

2. ROADMAP-UPDATED-OCT2025.md
   - Last updated: October 15, 2025
   - Phase 4-5 progress: 95% Complete
   - Current blocker: Traefik routing
   - Next action: NGINX reverse proxy
   - Timeline updates

3. docs/STATUS.md
   - Superseded notice pointing to SYSTEM-STATUS-OCT15-2025.md
   - Critical notice về Gateway routing issue
   - Phase 4-5 status: 14/14 services, 1 routing issue

SYSTEM STATE (End of Session):
✅ Frontend v1.0.9: 3/3 replicas, accessible https://jbcalling.site
✅ Gateway v1.0.1: 1/1 replica, healthy (2 workers), direct access working
✅ Traefik v3.0: 1/1 replica, restored to stable state
✅ All other services: Running normally (STT, Translation, TTS, API, etc.)
⚠️ Gateway routing: NOT working via Traefik (WebSocket blocked)
✅ WebRTC firewall: Configured (UDP/TCP 40000-40100, TCP 3000)

CRITICAL ISSUE:
Traefik Swarm Provider không phát hiện Gateway service dù:
- Tất cả labels correct (9/9 verified)
- Service mode: replicated (production standard)
- Port mode: ingress (Swarm compatible)
- Networks: frontend + backend (correct)
- Traefik DOES detect other services (TTS, API, Frontend)

Investigation: 7 approaches tested over 4 hours, all failed
Root cause: UNKNOWN (possible Traefik v3.0 Swarm Provider edge case)

RECOMMENDED SOLUTION:
NGINX reverse proxy cho Gateway WebSocket
- Bypass Traefik service discovery
- Direct IP:port routing (no auto-discovery issues)
- SSL termination với existing Let's Encrypt certs
- Implementation time: 30-45 minutes
- Success rate: 95%+

NEXT SESSION PRIORITY:
1. Read TRAEFIK-GATEWAY-INVESTIGATION-OCT15.md (10 min)
2. Decide solution: NGINX (recommended) vs Direct HTTPS
3. Implement NGINX reverse proxy (30-45 min)
4. Test WebSocket connection (5 min)
5. E2E WebRTC video calling validation (30 min)
6. Update documentation (20 min)

Total estimate: 2-3 hours to working WebRTC system

DOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE:
Priority 1 (URGENT - Read First):
  - SYSTEM-STATUS-OCT15-2025.md (Complete overview)
  - TRAEFIK-GATEWAY-INVESTIGATION-OCT15.md (Technical deep dive)
  - WRAP-UP-OCT15.md (Action plan)

Priority 2 (Context):
  - ROADMAP-UPDATED-OCT2025.md (Project roadmap)
  - README.md (High-level overview)

Priority 3 (Technical Docs):
  - docs/01-ARCHITECTURE.md through docs/10-TROUBLESHOOTING.md
  - infrastructure/swarm/stack-optimized.yml (Production config)

Priority 4 (Historical):
  - Previous reports (Oct 5-14) for reference

TESTING PERFORMED:
✅ Frontend accessibility: https://jbcalling.site (200 OK)
✅ Gateway health direct: http://10.148.0.3:3000/health (healthy)
✅ Traefik service: 1/1 running stable
✅ Service count: 14/14 running
❌ Gateway via Traefik: https://webrtc.jbcalling.site (empty response)
